# About me
My name is Shruti Karandikar, pronounced as she/her/hers

I am a Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University in Master of Information Systems Managementâ€™20 program. Prior to CMU, I was a Business Analyst at Credit Suisse. I was particularly responsible for business requirement gathering and providing an IT implementation plan. This exposure to millions of trade transactions across the world rooted my interest into data science & analytics.
 
Being at CMU, #1 college for Analytics, I continuously challenge myself in the technology domain to complement my functional knowledge. Courses like Java, Python and Machine Learning to help me extract insights from data and provide performance recommendations.

This is my last semester at CMU, and I want it to be a cherry on a cake :) 
Hence, I have chosen the subject - 'Telling Stories with Data'

# What I hope to learn from "Telling stories with Data" 
Ironically, I don't want to articulate any story for my data, instead I want to learn how to make data tell its own story!
Following Benjamin Franklin's thought, "Well done is better than well said" , I want to learn how to visualize and draw data in a creative and lucid form for the reader to understand it in a glance.

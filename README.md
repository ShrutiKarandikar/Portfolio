My name is Shruti Karandikar, pronounced as she/her/hers

I am a Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University in Master of Information Systems Management’20 program. Prior to CMU, I was a Business Analyst at Credit Suisse for a couple of years. I worked primarily on regulatory reporting of capital numbers. This exposure to millions of trade transactions across the world rooted my interest into data science & analytics. 
Being a career starter in a corporate firm, I realized how important yet difficult it is for women to be a leader in business or technology. Hence, for true career advancement, I decided to prepare myself for the upcoming challenges. I believed nothing else but a formal master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon University could polish my perspective and knowledge to tackle theoretical as well as real-world problems and make me #IndustryReady.

Inspired by Sheryl Sandberg's thought -  
> If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat

I'm ready to start one of the most exciting journeys of my life :)

# Life@CMU

Being at CMU, #1 college for Analytics, I continuously challenge myself in the technology domain to complement my functional knowledge. Courses like Java, Python and Machine Learning to help me extract insights from data and provide performance recommendations. I strive to convert 'data' into 'information'.<br>
But isn't a cake without a cherry incomplete? What if I extract data and I'm not able to convey my results to a wide audience? <br>

>This is my last semester at CMU, and I want it to be cherry on a cake :) 
>Hence, I have chosen the subject - 'Telling Stories with Data'

## What I hope to learn from "Telling stories with Data" 
Ironically, I don't want to articulate any story for my data, instead I want to learn how to make data tell its own story!
Following Benjamin Franklin's thought
> "Well done is better than well said" 

I want to learn how to visualize and draw data in a creative and lucid form for the reader to understand it in a glance.


## Interesting TSWD projects-

### Project 1 : Data Visualization
Data Visualizations representing  General Government Debts across Globe for year 2015.<br>
Source: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 

[Take me to Data Visualizations](DataViz2.md)

### Project 2 : Critiquing and Wireframing a solution

As a part of this course, I have learnt various techniques or mantras to work with data.<br>
One of which is - Best way to learn, creating a good visualization is through critiquing other visualizations.<br>
In this project I have attempted to redesign a web article published on Yahoo Finance, which talks about Apple as a company and its status in the market.<br>
Here is the link to original article : Jeremy Bowman, "Apple in 5 charts", last modified September 22, 2018 , [Apple in 5 charts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-5-charts-141500849.html)
 
Here is a link to my project<br>

### Final Project : Shorthand Visual

"In God we trust; All others must bring Data " - William Edwards Deming 

As a final milestone of this course, we are supposed to create a data visualization that will tell a story about a topic which we connect to. <br>
My project focuses on fashion and shopping. It surely connects to me, and as GenX, it should be exciting for my audience as well. The project is about finding what ‘Fast Fashion’ is all about and what its implications on the environment are. I have worked to collect data from multiple sources like news articles, books, interviews and Netflix documentaries. A consolidated working sheet of the data can be found [here](TSWD_Project_FastFashion.xlsx). This study concludes with a call for action for each and every one of us.<br>
I think this story is better seen than told. <br>

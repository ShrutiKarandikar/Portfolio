# Just Quarantine Things!


My mom always told me to do something productive, something good on the day of Gudi Padwa (Maharashtrian New Year). It’s probably because everyone says “Whatever you do on Gudi Padwa, you do it throughout the year”. So it better be good! <br>
All years until now, I have carefully watched TV and binged shows with all dedication but nothing seems to have worked!!! 

Except, this year, it seems to have worked like a charm!

**March 25, Gudi Padwa 2020**

Everything was routine, until we found ourselves in the unusual circumstances – Lockdown 2020.

Since we are home 24x7 and have almost exhausted our staple food from the refrigerator, I and my roommate thought to cook some traditional Indian lunch. Something which we could make quickly and with the basic ingredients we had. So we went ahead with the safest menu – Pongal & Kheer. I know, it’s not the most obvious menu, but she is from Telangana and I am from Maharashtra, so we were not only celebrating Gudi Padwa, but also Ugaadi 2020. [Diversity you see…. :P]

Looks pretty right? It was tasty as well ! Since this lunch, I have been cooking regularly!



**The Gudi Padwa magic has truely kicked in!**

Recently I thought, since I am already #QuarantineChef and #QuarantinePhotographer, why not tick one last thing on the list and become #QuarantineBlogger :P


But oops, I am a mediocre writer and a poor reader :D So let me give it a pass to write a blog post. But then.. what am I good at? I am good at making quick notes....ummm


### So here’s my Quaratine Cooking diary – A look at what magic Gudi Padwa cooking can do!

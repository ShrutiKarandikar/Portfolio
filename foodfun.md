# Just Quarantine Things!

My mom always told me to do something productive, something good on the day of Gudi Padwa (Maharashtrian New Year). It’s probably because everyone says “Whatever you do on Gudi Padwa, you do it throughout the year”. So…it better be good! <br>
All years until now, I have watched TV and binged shows with all dedication but nothing seems to have worked!!! Except, this year, it seems to have worked like a charm! <br>

Hi, I am Shruti, graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, always rooted in assignments and juggling between classes; having no particular interest in cooking; happily surviving on frozen food and rice. 
Everything was going well, until we all found ourselves in the usual circumstances – Lockdown 2020.
Now here we are with no access to nearby diners, restaurants and Starbucks! 
Fast forward to March 25, Gudi Padwa 2020
Since we are home 24*7 and have almost exhausted our staple food from the refrigerator, I and my roommate thought to cook some traditional Indian lunch. Something which we could make quickly and with the basic ingredients we had.  We went ahead with the safest menu – Pongal & Kheer. I know, it’s not the most obvious menu, but she is from Telangana and I am from Maharashtra, so we were not only celebrating Gudi Padwa, but also Ugaadi 2020. [Diversity you see…. :P] 
Anyway, coming back to lunch, I must say, it was one of the best lunches I have had in the US in last one year. It was the best way to celebrate New Year in a lockdown.   
And who knew, the Gudi Padwa magic would kick in. Since this lunch, I have been cooking regularly!
Recently I thought, since I am already #QuarantineChef and #QuarantinePhotographer, why not tick one last thing on the list and become #QuarantineBlogger :P 
But oops, I am a mediocre writer and a poor reader :D So let me give it a pass to write a blog post. But then.. what am I good at? I am good at making quick notes and creative to make decent sketches…. 
So here’s my Quaratine Cooking diary – A look at what magic Gudi Padwa cooking can do!

# Just Quarantine Things!


My mom always told me to do something productive, something good on the day of Gudi Padwa (Maharashtrian New Year). It’s probably because everyone says “Whatever you do on Gudi Padwa, you do it throughout the year”. So it better be good! <br>
All years until now, I have carefully watched TV and binged shows with all dedication but nothing seems to have worked!!! 

Except, this year, it seems to have worked like a charm!<br>

**March 25, Gudi Padwa 2020**

Everything was routine, until we found ourselves in the unusual circumstances – Lockdown 2020.

Since we are home 24x7 and have almost exhausted our staple food from the refrigerator, I and my roommate,Soumya, thought to cook some traditional Indian lunch. Something which we could make quickly and with the basic ingredients we had. So we went ahead with the safest menu – Pongal & Kheer. I know, it’s not the most obvious menu, but she is from Telangana and I am from Maharashtra, so we were not only celebrating Gudi Padwa, but also Ugaadi 2020. [Diversity you see…. :P]

Looks pretty right? It was tasty as well ! Since this lunch, I have been cooking regularly!



**The Gudi Padwa magic has truely kicked in!**

Recently I thought, since I am already #QuarantineChef and #QuarantinePhotographer, why not tick one last thing on the list and become #QuarantineBlogger :P


But oops, I am a mediocre writer and a poor reader :D So let me give it a pass to write a blog post. But then.. what am I good at? I am good at making quick notes....ummm


### So here’s my Quaratine Cooking diary – A look at what magic Gudi Padwa cooking can do!

**Week Six**

Summer Break + Binge watching + Home Quarantine = No chance for separate breakfast and lunch. 


I wake up too early for a lunch and too late for routine breakfast-lunch-dinner! What we have is Brunch-Slunch-Sinner cycle. (Thank you Soumya for the new words for Lunch+Snacks, Snacks+Dinner)  


No kidding, brunch is no more a choice, it’s the new normal. So well, there it is:  A pasta - chilli cheese toast brunch and a crepe - mashed potatoes - dark roast coffee combination for the morning cravings!

**Week Five**


Cheers to Graduation! With Graduation, comes vacation. And with a quarantine-vacation comes cooking++ 


Now I have all the time in this world to carefully make the recipe, plate it and click photos from every possible angle. With courtesy of Netflix, where I’ve binged plenty of cooking shows, my presentation skills have enhanced with a rather unusual pace :P


Below is a look at the artistic Aloo Palak followed by a lovely noodle soup, Ramen.

**Week Four**


Summer is here!!! Yes…and as expected the temperature now reaches 30 degree Celsius. It’s the best time to have a porch side grill, isn’t it? We recently got a new garden couch which has elaborately positioned itself on the front porch.


Here’s to the summer and the new couch!

**Week Three**

Argghhhh…..all I do entire day is eat and laze off! Goal for the week: Reduce Rice. 
Here are some really handy meals which I tried having no need for rice. Shout out to [this blog](https://holycowvegan.net/methi-matar-malai/) for the Methi Matar Recipe. And for a change, I literally had all the ingredients at hand!

**Week Two**


Pittsburgh is notoriously famous for its ever changing weather. But this time, it was bang on time. Spring season is on and today was the first day it rained! Being from Mumbai, can’t resist the urge of having crispy fried Bhajji….. and there we go…. 


![Bhajji](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59716372/83598158-055d3400-a537-11ea-8e04-81718aa55950.png)

**Week One**


Lectures are going on in full swing, have very less motivation to study and assignments are just piling up! Hence I wanted to make something which is not too complicated or time consuming. So this week was full of one dish meals, avoiding any sleep inducing agents like rice :)


![Pasta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59716372/83592722-f2dbfe00-a528-11ea-8b4e-bf9ef724faec.png)

Interesting thing for this was that it is made in wheat flour instead of maida(All purpose flour)! 

Recipe for this pasta can be found [here](https://cookingwidjoy.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/pasta-in-white-sauce-using-whole-wheat-flour/)!

To make this, I literally stuffed whatever I had into a taco shell - Mashed potatoes, capsicum, baked beans, salsa, 100 types of Indian Chutneys and of course, covered it in cheese. Nah Nah, no more thinking of diet :P

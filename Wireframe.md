# Critique and Wireframing Solutions

### Step 1: Choice of data visualization

In this project I have attempted to redesign a web article published on Yahoo Finance , which talks about Apple as a company and its status in the market.
Here is the link to original article : Jeremy Bowman, "Apple in 5 charts", last modified September 22, 2018 , https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-5-charts-141500849.html

The rationale behind choosing this visualization was that it tries to tell the story of a product in the dynamic stock market domain. In finance sector, which is already overwhelmed with charts, graphs and numbers, good data visualization techniques are critical to stand out and provide wise and accurate information. 
<p>Also, prior to CMU, I was working as a Business Analyst in Regulatory Reporting domain. I used to generate graphs, design dashboard and analyze numbers for a living. Hence I can relate very well to such visualizations and audience we are trying to connect to. 
<p> After searching for a while on various sources like The New York Times, The Economist etc I found out this article which focuses on Apple’s positioning in the market after release of iPhone Xs in 2018.  The title of the article was quite attractive “Apple in 5 charts”, which intrigued me to read further. Although, as  I read through it, I found a couple of issues with the graphs. 

#### Things that stood out to me & worked really well- <br>
1) Title of the article is attractive<br>
2) Information source is authentic , recent and relevant<br>
3) It has enough charts to elaborate / visualize. Less verbose content<br>


#### Things I thought would have been done differently - <br>

I have pasted the graphs from the original website below for easire reference -

In the above graphs, I would focus on modifying below - <br>
1) Updated colour-scheme of the visualizations - Colours are too bright for a laptop/mobile screen (Fluorescent yellow & green on white background)<br>
2) The title reads "Apple in 5 charts". But in practice there are only 3 charts and one is an image of iphone XS model. I would make the data and title consistent <br>
3) All the bar graphs & pie charts are 3- Dimensional. I do not find it necessary / relevant to give depth dimension to the chart. Hence would edit them to make a simpler visualization.<br>
4) In last 2 graphs ("Iphone unit sales" and  "Iphone average selling price in Dollars") , x axis years are in reverse order ( starts with 2018 and ends at 2015) This is counter intuitive to what we generally expect. Hence would redesign these bar graphs.

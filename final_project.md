# Final Project

### The art of story telling
“The world is one big data problem.” – by Andrew McAfee, co-director of the MIT Initiative
And as a part of this project, we were able to pick any data which we felt was intriguing and important to be discussed in this forum. This final project was the climax of the course and was equally rewarding.<br>
I could apply everything which I had learnt over the course of 6 weeks and had complete freedom to experiment, elaborate and adjust!  <br>
### The Idea, Design and User Research
As part of Part I and Part II of the project, we had conceptualized about the story we had to tell. Initially I had thought of using a Netflix dataset which I had with me. My plan was to show some of the cool binge watching trends or usage statistics. <br>
But, that dataset was not publically available. Also, after the first round of discussions in class, I released that I really had no ‘Call for action’ for that type of statistics  Feedback from my batch mates was really helpful in narrowing down on another topic, which was my final topic - Fast Fashion. 
<br>I went ahead and prepared the content, looked for relevant sources and kind of thought about how can I present it to a group of people who have learnt to critique so well !<br> Never the less, this was my story arc – 

Other details, initial sketched can be found HERE!<br>
After intensive research and finalizing on the method and medium of the project, we moved to Part – II. 
It’s time to display your work outside the boundaries of the room. User research was a crucial part in this section. After creating the initial wireframes, I interviewed 5 of my friends ( Of which only 3 could make to a mention on the page :P ) Initially I sent my drafts to most of my classmates and realized the feedback was more or less the same. This made me think that I had to expand my users from CMU to any other background so that I’ll get holistic feedback. Post this realization, I collected feedback from friends back in India, along with US ; I tried to maintain a balance of gender amongst interviewees and finally I chose people who like fashion as well as people who did not care much about fashion.
This page captures the details about all the feedback and updates made to the design. 

### Intended Audience
Although ‘Fashion’ is subjective, ‘Fast Fashion’ and its impacts can be cannot be limited to a group of people. People from every walk of life should care about it and introspect on their spending patterns. 
From a perspective of my presentation, I knew that my audience is going to be my classmates, who have worked a lot on data, have public policy background and have critique’s eye! To make sure my content was appropriate and relevant to this audience, I had to be accurate with numbers, picky about the sources of data be sure not to be boring. 
<br> The in-class activity of reviewing each other’s work helped me a lot. I had a healthy discussion on what is working really well and what can be improved. 
<br> I was really appreciated for my story arc and the content in the discussion. They thought it was appealing , engaging and information. Although I received suggestions on my Call For Action. <br>
Essentially my original Call for action only intended people to choose sustainable clothing over fast fashion. But the group reacted as, “Ok, I can choose sustainability, but HOW?” 
<br>I had missed this point completely. This happened probably because it was quite intuitive to me given my research. But as a reader, I it wasn’t very obvious. Hence, I introduced my last section “What can we do about it” into my project. <br>
Incorporating this feedback made my study more realistic and practical. Big shout out to my group, TAs and of course Professor !

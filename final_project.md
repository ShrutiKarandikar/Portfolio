# Final Project - Part III
### The art of story telling
In words of Andrew McAfee, co-director of the MIT Initiative
>This world is one big data problem.

As a part of this project, we were expected to pick a dataset which was intriguing and important enough to be discussed in our forum. This final project was climax of the course and was equally rewarding.<br>
I could apply everything which I learnt over the course of 6 weeks and had complete freedom to experiment, elaborate and adjust!  <br>
### The Idea, Design and User Research
As part of Part I and Part II of the project, I conceptualized about the story I wanted to tell. Initially I had thought of using a Netflix dataset which I had with me. My plan was to show some of the cool binge watching trends or usage statistics. <br>
But, that dataset was not publically available. Also, after first round of discussions in class, I released that I really had no specific ‘Call for action’ which I could provide for that type of statistics  Feedback from my batch mates was really helpful in narrowing down on another topic, which became my final topic - Fast Fashion. 
<br>I went ahead and prepared the content, looked for relevant sources and kind of thought about how can I present it to a group of people who have learnt to critique so well !<br> Never the less, this was my story arc –

Other details, initial sketches can be found here [Part - I](final_project_Shruti.md)!<br>
After intensive research and finalizing on the method and medium of the project, we moved to [Part – II](final_project_partII.md) 

It was time to display your work outside the boundaries of classroom. User research was a crucial part in this section. After creating the initial wireframes, I interviewed 5 of my friends ( Of which only 3 could make it to a mention on my final page :P ) Initially I sent my drafts to most of my classmates and realized the feedback was more or less the same. This made me think that I had to expand my users from CMU to any other background so that I’ll get holistic feedback. Post this realization; I collected feedback from friends back in India along with the US. I tried to maintain a balance of gender amongst interviewees and finally I chose people who like fashion as well as people who did not care much about fashion.
This page captures the details about all the feedback and updates made to the design. 

### Intended Audience
Although ‘Fashion’ is subjective, ‘Fast Fashion’ and its impacts can be cannot be limited to a group of people. People from every walk of life should care about it and introspect on their spending patterns. <br>
From a perspective of my presentation, I knew that my audience is going to be my classmates, who have worked enough on data, have public policy background and have a critique’s eye as well! To ensure that my content was appropriate and relevant to this audience, I had to be accurate with numbers, picky about sources of data and avoid being boring. 
<br> In this process, in-class activity of reviewing each other’s work helped me a lot. I had a healthy discussion on what is working really well and what can be improved. 
<br> I was really appreciated for my story arc and the content in the in-class discussion. My review group thought it was appealing, engaging and informative. Although, I received improvement suggestions on my Call For Action. <br>
Essentially my original Call for action only intended to make people choose sustainable clothing over fast fashion. But the group reacted “Ok, I can choose sustainability, but HOW?”  My project missed the plan on how one can help reduce impact of fast fashion.
<br>I had missed this point completely, probably because it was quite intuitive to me given my research. But as a reader, I it wasn’t very obvious. Hence, I introduced my last section “What can we do about it” into my project which highlights a few actions which we could take as individuals to contribute towards sustainability.<br>
Incorporating this feedback made my study more realistic and practical. Big shout out to my group, TAs and of course Professor! <br>

To make the project more relatable, I had created 2 personas – Fastie (representing a Fast Fashion brand) and Slowie (representing any other sustainable fashion brand) My plan was to show comparisons in the business process of Fastie and Slowie.

But after interviewing, I found out that it is really not helping to personify the companies to make the concept relatable. Hence, I shifted the gears converted into type of people. So basically, I attributed various lifestyle traits to Fastie and Slowie and suggested that people can either chose to be a Fastie or a Slowie in real life. And this idea got me real good feedback and people liked it much more than earlier one!

Phew. After all this drawing and redrawing, finally I had my updated version of the project. <br>
Below is the outcome of all this painstaking drafting and visualizing of data. Hope you’ll find it intriguing enough and help you make informed decisions about your spending. <br>
Happy Shopping!

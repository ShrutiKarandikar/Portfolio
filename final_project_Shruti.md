# "FAST FASHION" is the new fashion...

Who likes to shop ? Who loves 'Retail Therapy' ? Are you uploading your OOTD?!<br>
One might wonder are these even questions! There is just one answer to these - EVERYONE :) <br>

But before doing this, do we think about its implications? Ummm....May be not everyone.<br> 
To dwelve into this topic and know more about your shopping habits read along.

## Final Project - Fast Fashion or Sustainable Fashion

### Outline 

#### Summary 
This project introduces the concept of Fast Fashion, analyses its exponential growth in fashion industry and highlights its social and environmental impacts.

As a reader, I would want to know more about what are implications of my shopping habits or am I being manipulated? So that, I can make a well informed decisions about spending and having a sustainable living. 

#### Structure 

Since the topic is relatively under the cover yet, I would first want to explain the concept of Fast Fashion. Give clarifications about how unknowingly, we, as end consumers, support fashion brands to produce quick, cheap and disposable apparels at the cost of natural resources. I will talk about how mass production of apparels with synthetic materials is depleting forests, utilizing water and other scarce resources.  To exemplify the argument I’ll supplement it by giving relatable examples and taking a closer look at Zara and its business model. This section will involve use of various data visualization techniques which I have learnt in this course. I’ll try to put across my point using appropriate colour scheme, typography and choosing suitable charts where ever necessary. <br>

Once the topic is introduced and reader is made aware of its seriousness, she will automatically be engaged into the topic. (Hopefully) (The way I was engaged when I heard about it for the first time!) <br>

#### Call for action 
The article will conclude with call for action, as to how as individuals, we can contribute towards creating a sustainable living for us and future generations. We should try to reuse atleast 3 apparels each month, consider buying from earth friendly brands and shop responsibly.<br>



### Happy Shopping !

## The Data
This project highlights a change in consumer behaviour and fashion industry trends in the last decade. I couldn't find a single dataset incorporating all the aspects of Fashion industry at a single source. But, there is enough literature in form of news & web articles, books, discussions and talks. Hence, I have collected all the different data points into excel which will be used for bringing out the story with visualizations.<br>
Here is the [dataset](https://github.com/ShrutiKarandikar/Portfolio/blob/master/TSWD_Project_FastFashion.xlsx).  Each sheet in the dataset has its source specified separately.  <br>

  - Strategies for call for action




## Method and Medium
This project is aimed at conveying a message (call for action) to its readers. I have chosen to tell a story of that tee shirt which was worn only twice, that denim which lies only in the wardrobe and that jacket which was never used after flaunting your O.O.T.D.
To ensure that the message is conveyed in a receptive attitude, understanding my audience is a crucial part for this project. 

I started my work with collecting as much resources as possible on this topic. This included web articles, news journals, youtube videos and even Netflix documentary. This data collection phase gave me further insights about what work is already done in this area. Followed by data collection, I started thinking about the story arch. To come up with a story arch, I basically asked myself these questions – 

1. Who is my target audience? 
2. What is my story?
3. What should my reader understand after going through my work?
4. What is the call for action for my reader? 


Once these questions were answered, my story arch was ready (which is presented above). Followed by this, I drew initial sketches, with a wireframe about how will I ensure that data will unfold the story.     

After creating basic wireframes, I sent it across for feedback to a few colleagues and friends. The feedback received was:   
"I love your story arc...it's so cool!!!"

So, have got nothing to change :) Yeay !

Next steps in the project<br> 
* I will be using Tableau and Rawgraphs for creating most of the graphs in the project. 
* This project is based on a very attractive and aesthetically pleasing industry – FASHION. Hence my work should also possess some of these characteristics. I have chosen Shorthand as my platform to bring across the point of FAST FASHION. Shorthand provides various templates where I can use images as background and describe the context very well with graphs. 


I hope the final project turns out to be intriguing and informative for the readers. Stay tuned !

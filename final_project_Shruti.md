# "FAST FASHION" is the new fashion...

Who likes to shop ? Who loves 'Retail Therapy' ? Are you uploading your OOTD?!<br>
One might wonder are these even questions! There is just one answer to these - EVERYONE :) <br>

But before doing this, do we think about its implications? Ummm....May be not everyone.<br> 
To dwelve into this topic and know more about your shopping habits read along.

## Final Project - Fast Fashion or Sustainable Fashion
This project introduces the concept of Fast Fashion, analyses its exponential growth in fashion industry and highlights its social and environmental impacts.

As a reader, I would want to know more about what are implications of my shopping habits or am I being manipulated? So that, I can make a well informed decisions about spending and having a sustainable living. 



Since the topic is relatively under the cover yet, I would first want to explain the concept of Fast Fashion. Give clarifications about how unknowingly, we, as end consumers, support fashion brands to produce quick, cheap and disposable apparels at the cost of natural resources. I will talk about how mass production of apparels with synthetic materials is depleting forests, utilizing water and other scarce resources.  To exemplify the argument I’ll supplement it by giving relatable examples and taking a closer look at Zara and its business model. This section will involve use of various data visualization techniques which I have learnt in this course. I’ll try to put across my point using appropriate colour scheme, typography and choosing suitable charts where ever necessary. <br>

Once the topic is introduced and reader is made aware of its seriousness, she will automatically be engaged into the topic. (Hopefully) (The way I was engaged when I heard about it for the first time!) <br>

The article will conclude with call for action, as to how as individuals, we can contribute towards creating a sustainable living for us and future generations. <br>



Happy Shopping !

## The Data
This project highlights a change in consumer behaviour and fashion industry trends in the last decade. I couldn't find a single dataset incorporating all the aspects of Fashion industry at a single source. But, there is enough literature in form of news & web articles, books, discussions and talks. Hence, I have collected all the different data points into excel which will be used for bringing out the story with visualizations.<br>
Here is the dataset[dataset](https://github.com/ShrutiKarandikar/Portfolio/blob/master/TSWD_Project_FastFashion.xlsx).  Each sheet in the dataset has its source specified separately.

# Fashion: Style that's sustainable
In the previous part of my final project, I had narrowed down on topic, dataset and target audience. I had identified medium of my project to be Shorthand and presented a few initial graphs. This analysis was supplemented with a sketched story arc and story board for my project. Overall, Part I gave an idea about how I’m planning to shape my project.  <br>
In Part II, I’ll focus on refining the actual narrative by formulating graphs with solid data points and a couple of visualizations. Once I’m done with this, I’ll send it across to a few users and collect feedback from them. This user research will help me analyze on how effectively I’m able to convey my thoughts through my visualizations.  <br>
With the feedback, I’m hoping to improvise on perception, intuitiveness and aesthetics of my visualizations for the project
 
# Initial Storyboard

This storyboard is inspired from the hand sketched version. I have used Canva to create this storyboard. Most of the graphs, infographics in this storyboard are made using Tableu or Infogram. Source of images is cited in the story itself, but roughly they are from Unsplash.com and Pexels.com<br>

# User Research Protocol
## Target Audience

My story talks to anyone who spends on clothing. We all should be aware and concerned about our contribution towards environment and its impacts. Having said that, ‘Fast Fashion’ is a topic which is most relatable the youth or anyone who has an eye for fashion. It’s impacts can be mitigated if we focus on this subset of people. Hence my target audience are my friends , who will have to make a choice of Sustainable v/s Fast clothing. <br>

## Approach to identify representative individuals
To make the feedback fulfilling, I chose 5 people from different geographies, background and gender. All of them belonged to an age group of 22-29 which are interested in fashion in varying amount.

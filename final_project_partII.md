# Fashion: Style that's sustainable
In the previous part of my final project, I had narrowed down on topic, dataset and target audience. I had identified medium of my project to be Shorthand and presented a few initial graphs. This analysis was supplemented with a sketched story arc and story board for my project. Overall, Part I gave an idea about how I‚Äôm planning to shape my project.  <br>
In Part II, I‚Äôll focus on refining the actual narrative by formulating graphs with solid data points and a couple of visualizations. Once I‚Äôm done with this, I‚Äôll send it across to a few users and collect feedback from them. This user research will help me analyze on how effectively I‚Äôm able to convey my thoughts through my visualizations.  <br>
With the feedback, I‚Äôm hoping to improvise on perception, intuitiveness and aesthetics of my visualizations for the project
 
# Initial Storyboard

This storyboard is inspired from the hand sketched version. I have used Canva to create this storyboard. Most of the graphs, infographics in this storyboard are made using Tableu or Infogram. Source of images is cited in the story itself, but roughly they are from Unsplash.com and Pexels.com<br>

# User Research Protocol
## Target Audience

My story talks to anyone who spends on clothing. We all should be aware and concerned about our contribution towards environment and its impacts. Having said that, ‚ÄòFast Fashion‚Äô is a topic which is most relatable the youth or anyone who has an eye for fashion. It‚Äôs impacts can be mitigated if we focus on this subset of people. Hence my target audience are my friends , who will have to make a choice of Sustainable v/s Fast clothing. <br>

## Approach to identify representative individuals
To make the feedback fulfilling, I chose 5 people from different geographies, background and gender. All of them belonged to an age group of 22-29 which are interested in fashion in varying amount. 

## Interview script
Q1 ) Are you engaged enough to go through the entire page and read ?<br>
Q2) Are the visualizations aiding understanding of the topic or they are too many / too little? <br>
Q3) Do think asthetics of the visualizations match the context and topic in general? <br>
Q4) Do you have any suggestion for improvisation? <br>
Q5) Do you feel the need to introspect your spending habits? <br>

#### Interviewiee 1 <br>
1. Yes - I did read everything.<br>
2. Yes - I was able to understand the topic and concept. Starting with the background,  the trend change of shopping and  followed by the call of action.<br>
3. Yes - It did, and all the visualizations and the drawings matches the topic.
4. Everything was well understandable by me, who didnt have a background about Fast Fashion.
5. I do spend a lot on clothes. I too have a habit of not repeating clothes. But at the same time, I do believe in the concept of reusing the clothes.<br>

#### Interviewiee 2 
1. Yes.  the effects of the fashion industry on our lives is increasing and I'm interested in knowing more about it. This story board gives the high-level info needed to understand what drives this industry.

2. Yes there are. The visualisations create a sort of a story-telling atmosphere that gives a better view of the topic.
The use of unrelated pics at the start of the presentation might seem a bit much though.

3. No, I'm good. I personally don't spend a lot of time clothes shopping (but this has given me more ammunition to try and stop others from shoppingüòÅ).

4. I think it does. The use of images that compliment the background of the presentation is a nice touch.

5. If you mean for improvement, then id like to point one slide that just has pictures with no context. It'll be better to just remove it

#### Interviewee 3 
Q1) Yes, I went through the whole page.
Q2) Visualizations are adequate enough to express the topic in the shortest time possible.
Q3) Based on the message put forward in the presentation and my personal hobby of living a fashionable life, I feel the need for introspection as my spending habit has affected the environment and ecosystem that I did not know before.
Q4) Yes, I do feel that the aesthetics of the visualization match the context of the presentation. All the relevant data is represented in human-understandable diagrams along with various visuals representing the exact topic.
Q5) More focus can be put on the mitigation strategy for the represented topic. There are a couple of other factors that add up to carbon footprint which include the use of single-use plastic hangers for clothing arrangement and their management. Gap, which is a global brand throws its hangers in dumpsters just after a single use to display their line up clothing. Such supportive topics can also be incorporated to make the topic more impactful.
